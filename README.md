# Hangman-Game
A basic Hangman game is implemented using the provided Python code. The player guesses a word by entering individual letters after the program chooses a word at random from a predetermined word bank. Before a loss is declared in the game, a player may make up to seven incorrect guesses. Choosing a word, showing the current guesses for the letters, accepting guesses from the user, updating the guesses-based game state, and determining if there is a win or loss condition are among the functions. The primary function coordinates the entire game flow, showing the current situation and taking user input until the player guesses the word correctly or hits the maximum number of wrong guesses permitted.
